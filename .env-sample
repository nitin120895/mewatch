#
# All other variables will only be available on the server via the same naming.
#
# When built, environment variables should be injected specific
# to the environment their targeting. They do not need to come from
# a .env file e.g. they could come from a CI task. If there is a .env file and
# a clashing variable passed in, then the one passed in will trump the .env file's version.

# Modern browsers support the option of preloading assets that are known
# to be needed for a site. For example web fonts, background image,
# javascript files etc.
#
# Preloading will trigger a download of these assets as a medium/high
# priority once the initial html page has downloaded meaning they can
# be accessed sooner by the site.
#
# You should be conservative with what you preload and only include
# those resources that are absolutely required by the site to function.
#
# We automatically preload the common JavaScript chunks, but if you know
# of web fonts or other assets that are mandatory then you can define
# them here in a comma delimited list.
#
# Each entry in the list should be prefixed with the type of
# asset it targets followed by a colon and the url.
#
# Supported types include:
#
# - script    javascript resources
# - style     css resources
# - image     image resources
# - font      font resources
# - document  html resources
#
# See the full list under the 'destination' column here:
# https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-destination
#
# There's good write up on preload (and prefetch) here:
# https://medium.com/reloading/preload-prefetch-and-priorities-in-chrome-776165961bbf
#
# If a resource defined here has a third party domain it will be
# added to the resource hint "preconnect" list for establishing
# an early https connection.
#
# As with all optimizations, you should check adding extra preload assets
# improves performance for you. A good way of proving that is through
# throttling traffic.
#
# You should also check that double downloads don't occur as this can
# sometimes be the case if the same assets is initiated to load around
# the same time.
#PRELOAD_ASSET=font:https://example.com/fonts/font.woff

# When the site served is in production and host name should
# begin with `www` enable this option to force a redirect
# if the www isn't present.
#
#    https://domain.com -> https://www.domain.com
#WWW_REDIRECT=true

# Enabling basic authentication can be useful in non-production environments
# to restrict access where whitelisting isn't practical. For example
# when an external service needs to run tests on the site.
#BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=username

# Defines how long an entry in cache is seen as fresh.
# Once past this time a request for the same entry
# will trigger a stale hit and background refresh.
#
# Unlike Rocket this does not also define the cache control
# max-age response header. That will always be set
# to no-cache as we have such variation in what we render
# based on user and browser variables.
#
# If undefined, defaults to 60 seconds.
#CACHE_MAX_AGE=60

# The minimum time to live (TTL) in seconds a cache entry should remain in, and be
# served from cache. If a cache entry is found which is over its CACHE_MAX_AGE then
# it will still be served, however request(s) will also be made to Rocket to
# repopulate the cache entry in the background, so subsequent requests get the
# updated version. This has a big impact on performance but does increase the
# chance of stale content being served. In a VOD environment where content doesn't
# change too often the benefits usually outweigh the potential risks.
# In a live TV environment, tuning this down may be wise.
# To disable this behavior and always use the MAX AGE of the request
# as the TTL set this value to 0 or comment it out.
#
# If undefined, defaults to 600 seconds.
#CACHE_MIN_TTL=600

# Cache warming ensures certain defined pages are always served from cache when
# accessed directly (i.e. server render of page is cached and returned).
# This can be a huge performance benefit on pages which are common entry points
# like the home page.
#
# When defining pages to warm you should include any filters to apply like
# subscription code. By default an empty subscription code will assume 'Anonymous'.
#
# Keep in mind that cache warming does mean 24 hour regular calls to keep pages
# in cache so you should be selective over which pages to cache and as generous
# as makes sense for your project with CACHE_MIN_TTL.
#
# Cache warming is based around the CACHE_MIN_TTL value.
#
# - If the CACHE_MIN_TTL is <= 120 seconds no cache warming will run as the churn
# would be quite high (CACHE_MIN_TTL is recommended to be at least 300 seconds).
# - When greater than 120 the cache warmer will inspect the cache at regular
# intervals to ensure all defined pages are in cache.
#   - It will base its next check time on the entry which will expire first.
#   - It will also not warm any entry if it has more than 60 seconds TTL remaining.
#     Instead it will check back a little closer to its expiry and warm it if it's not been
#     updated since the last check.
#   - We also randomize cache check times to reduce impact when horizontal scaling nodes.
#
# Example to cache home page for Anonymous and Registered users:
#
#    [{"path":"/"},{"path":"/","sub":"Registered"}]
#
CACHE_WARM=[{"path":"/"}]

# WARNING: Do not enable in production.
#
# When an error occurs during a server render the server will log the error
# and then fallback to serving the application shell. This ensures
# end users are always presented with a functioning website and not a low level error.
#
# This fallback is correct in production but can obscure visibility of these errors
# during development and QA (they are still logged however).
#
# To increase visibility this flag will return the raw error and stack trace to
# the web browser instead of the app shell.
#
# Note when debugging server rendering locally this flag will be enabled by default.
#
# Recommended to enable in your test environment only.

# When enabled, a service worker will be served from the web server
# enabling smart caching and offline capabilities for browsers which
# support them.
#
# The benefits are improved performance, support for offline / flaky
# connections, push notifications, background syncing, installing a
# web app to homescreen on some devices (e.g. Android) and reduced
# server traffic.
#
# A service worker will use a previously cached version of a web app
# on future visits. It will download version updates but a user will
# only see these the next time they arrive on the site. For this reason
# you should enable this option only if the site owner is happy with this.
#
# If undefined then defaults to disabled.
#FF_SERVICE_WORKER=true

# When enabled, React will be swapped out for Preact (https://preactjs.com).
# This can reduce the libs.js by 100kb+, improving load times and time

# may be subtle differences to React. Testing is recommended to ensure
# any such issues are uncovered early.

# Permissive / Restrictive Defaults:
#
# The two approaches are to either restrict everything, and then opt in
# to supporting things on a case by case basis (preferred), or alternatively
# you instead set a permissive default, and then restrict things on a case
# by case basis.
#
# In the latter situation rules don't inherit whitelisted domains from the
# default rule which means as soon as you add additional restrictions you
# end up with duplication and a larger header filesize.
# To avoid this we are restrictive by default with the benefit of providing
# maximum security.

# Common whitelist domains used across several rules.
#
# By default we include 'self' which is the domain the application
# is served on, as well as a wildcard subdomain inferred from the value
# of `CLIENT_SERVICE_URL`.
#
# For the application to function correctly we need to support our
# service urls. These are generally covered by our wildcard however if
# the domain of `CLIENT_SERVICE_CDN_URL` or `CLIENT_ASSET_URL` doesn't
# match the wildcard then we automatically include them too.
#
# If you need to add additional domains to the common whitelist you can add
# them here. There's no need to duplicate the sub-domains from the above defaults.
#
# For public content delivery networks we recommend using a CNAME value.
# If you do need to whitelist your public CDN then ensure you add your
# exact sub domain rather than wildcarding it since the latter is too permissive!
# e.g. 'd2chcznrfl8lqh.cloudfront.net' instead of '*.cloudfront.net'
#
#CSP_WHITELIST_DOMAINS=["*.domain.com"]

# CSP violations can be logged to a custom location by providing a Reporting URI.
#
# Defaults to Slingshots `/log/csp` endpoint if undefined
#
#CSP_REPORTING_URI=/log/csp
CSP_REPORT_ONLY=false

# If this is set, we will ignore FF_CSP and CSP_REPORT_ONLY and enforce CSP with frame-ancestors directive only
CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS_ONLY=false

# CSP nonce values are generated using a salt phrase which should be unguessable.
# At a minimum it's recommended to set a unique salt phrase per project.
#
CSP_NONCE_SALT=SydneyLondonPrague

# Whitelisting iFrames is controlled via the `frame-src` property for
# CSP level 1 and 3, and via the deprecated `child-src` property for
# level 2. Note that `child-src` also controlled web workers, however
# these now have their own `worker-src` property within level 3.
#
# The 'X2' Page Entry row allows content operators to schedule an iframe
# row within the page using any url they enter. To support this we need to
# allow a wildcard (*) for the `frame-src` rule.
#
# When true `frame-src: *;` will be used to allow any url.
#
# When false (omitted entirely) it will use the common whitelist with any
# augmented domains from the below third party services integrations.
#
# This property exists purely as a convenience. Only enable this if you intend
# to support the X2 row within your app/environment!
#
CSP_IFRAME_WILDCARD=true

# Third party services need to be opted into via the below flags.
#
# The flags are grouped by feature. You can enable one ore more service
# per group by providing the service name(s) as a comma separated list.
#
# Refer to `/src/server/security/csp/*.ts` for the available services.
# Add your own additional services as needed.
